# Wind At Your Back (WAYBack)

> "You're 20 seconds behind your goal for the midpoint, let's try to make those up in the next mile!"

WAYBack is an app targeting people who engage in endurance workouts -  runs, bike rides, etc, in which they aim to complete the workout in a certain timeframe, and want in-workout audio feedback detailing how they are doing against their goal, much like a coach would provide.

## Design

WAYBack tracks your **time surplus** as you run. If you finish a mile at `8:30`, and were targeting a `9:00` pace, you've built up a 30 second surplus. Notifications are driven by this surplus.

By focusing on your surplus, you turn the mechanical act of completing the run into the game of *banking* some seconds or minutes in addition. Banked minutes can be redeemed for IRL rewards at some point in the future, but for now they are their own reward. I enjoy thinking of them as minutes of additional healthy life I've earned!

## Features

  1. Set up the parameters of your workout _(Example: 10 mile run, 9:00/mile target pace, assessments every mile)_
  1. Start your workout in the app, and IRL
  1. If needed, pause the workout (dont cheat - unpause approximately where you paused)
  1. Enjoy the audio cues

## Background

Very often we *know* that something we're doing is important, but we can get bogged down and lose motivation during that activity. At these points, some well-timed psychological encouragement can mean all the difference.
